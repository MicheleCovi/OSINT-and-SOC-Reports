# OSINT Reports

This folder contains my personal OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) investigations and exercises.

The goal is to practice and improve my skills in collecting and analyzing publicly available information, using tools and manual techniques.

These reports are made for educational purposes and to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Topics I cover:
- Person/Target profiling
- Metadata analysis
- Social media footprint
- Website investigation
- DNS and IP research

I'm still learning and experimenting, so feedback is always welcome!
