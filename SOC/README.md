# SOC Reports

This folder contains my personal projects and practice reports related to SOC (Security Operations Center) operations and blue team exercises.

The reports focus on hands-on simulations, threat hunting, detection techniques, and incident response workflows.  
All content is developed for educational purposes to improve my skills in real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

## Topics I explore:
- Log analysis and triage
- Phishing detection and email header analysis
- Windows/Linux threat detection
- Scheduled tasks and persistence techniques
- Detection engineering
- SIEM correlation rules (Splunk basics)
- Endpoint analysis (EDR basics)

Iâ€™m still learning and growing as a junior SOC analyst, so feedback is always appreciated!
