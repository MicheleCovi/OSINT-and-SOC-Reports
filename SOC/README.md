# SOC Reports

This folder contains my personal projects and practice reports related to SOC (Security Operations Center) operations and blue team exercises.

The reports focus on hands-on simulations, threat hunting, detection techniques, and incident response workflows.  
All content is developed for educational purposes to improve my skills in real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

## Topics I explore:
- Log analysis and triage
- Windows/Linux threat detection
- Scheduled tasks and persistence techniques
- Detection engineering
- SIEM correlation rules (Splunk basics)
- Endpoint analysis (EDR basics)

## ðŸ“„ Reports Available:
- [PhishingAnalysis_1.pdf](./phishing/PhishingAnalysis_1.pdf) â€“ Email spoofing case targeting Bradesco clients, with sender impersonation and failed SPF/DKIM/DMARC.
